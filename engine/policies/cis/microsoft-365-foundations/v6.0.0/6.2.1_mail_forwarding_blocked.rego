# METADATA
# title: Ensure all forms of mail forwarding are blocked and/or disabled
# description: |
#   Transport rules that automatically forward or redirect mail to external
#   recipients pose a significant data exfiltration risk. Additionally,
#   outbound spam filter policies must have AutoForwardingMode set to Off.
#   Rules that whitelist domains by setting SCL to -1 also pose security risks.
