# METADATA
# title: Ensure 'third-party storage services' are restricted in 'Microsoft 365 on the web'
# description: |
#   Third-party storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, etc.) can be
#   enabled for users in Microsoft 365 on the web, allowing them to store and
#   share documents outside organizational control alongside OneDrive and
#   team sites. This increases the risk of data breaches and makes it
#   difficult to maintain data privacy and security. Restrict the "Third
#   Party Storage Services" service principal in Entra ID to prevent this.
