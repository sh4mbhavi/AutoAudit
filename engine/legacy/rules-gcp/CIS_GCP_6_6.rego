READ_REPLICA_INSTANCE because these instances inherit their settings from the
primary instance. Also, note that first generation instances cannot be configured
to have a private IP address.

3. Ensure that the setting ipAddresses has an IP address configured of type:

public addresses. An instance can have both a private and public address at the
same time. Note also that you cannot use private IP with First Generation
instances.`
